                Devotional Thought
              </h3>
              <p style={{ color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.78)", fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: 1.85 }}>
                The cross is not decoration. It is not just something we wear, hang on a wall, or use as a church
                symbol. The cross is the place where surrender becomes real. Jesus said that anyone who wants to
                follow Him must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Him. That means the cross is not
                simply what Jesus carried for us. It is also the life He calls us into with Him.
              </p>
              <p style={{ color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.78)", fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: 1.85 }}>
                At the cross, self-rule dies. Pride dies. Sin loses its throne. The old life is no longer in control.
                Galatians 2:20 reminds us that we have been crucified with Christ, and the life we now live is by
                faith in the Son of God. Unashamed faith is not cheap faith. It is a surrendered life that says, “Jesus,
                You are not just my Savior. You are Lord.”
              </p>
              <p style={{ color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.78)", fontSize: "1.05rem", lineHeight: 1.85 }}>
                The world wants a comfortable cross, but Jesus calls us to a costly one. The Gospel is still the power
                of God for salvation, and we are not ashamed of it. Today, do not just admire the cross. Carry it. Do
                not just sing about surrender. Live it. The cross may confront your flesh, but it will also lead you into
                resurrection life.
