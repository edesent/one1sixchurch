                  You obeyed Jesus, and things got harder. Does that mean you took a wrong turn?
                  In Mark 4:35–37, the disciples follow Jesus&apos; direction and still encounter a fierce
                  storm. Their obedience is real, and so is their danger. In John 16:33, Jesus tells His
                  followers they will face trouble, but He has overcome the world. Difficulty alone
                  cannot tell us whether we are following God&apos;s will. We need Scripture to examine
                  our path. If we are disobeying, His grace calls us to turn back. If we are obeying,
                  His grace sustains us through the pressure. Jesus obeyed the Father perfectly,
                  bore the judgment our sins deserved on the cross, and rose again. We receive
                  salvation by grace through faith; we cannot earn His love through obedience.
                  Because we belong to Him, we learn to follow His voice, even when it costs us.
                  You do not have to see the whole journey to obey Him in your next decision.
                  The storm is loud. But it is not Lord. Jesus is.
                  Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm on truth. Live unashamed.
