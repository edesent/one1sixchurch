                  You have asked Jesus to speak to your storm. But what happens when His Word
                  speaks to you? In Mark 4:41, the disciples marvel that even the wind and waves
                  obey Him. Jesus is the Son of God, the Lord of the sea, and His authority
                  reaches our everyday choices. James 1:22 calls us to put God&apos;s Word into
                  practice. Knowing the truth must shape the way we live. Our obedience cannot
                  erase sin or earn salvation: Ephesians 2:8–10 teaches that we are saved by
                  grace through faith, created in Christ Jesus for good works. Jesus obeyed the
                  Father perfectly, bore the judgment our sins deserved at the cross, died, and
                  rose again. Because we belong to this living Savior, we confess our sin,
                  receive His mercy, and follow His voice. His mercy also leads us toward the
                  hurting and overlooked, sharing His love and Gospel beyond our usual circle.
                  Name what you need to surrender and take the next clear step of obedience.
                  You do not need control over tomorrow to follow Him today.
                  Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm on truth. Live unashamed.
